Here is some helpful text to describe the CSI tool and how it works.  This should be updated at the very end to make sure it's all up-to-date. 

**************************CSI HELP*****************************

DISPLAYING RATIOED SPECTRA: 
Use the L-click on your mouse to choose the location of the ROI numerator (red), and the R-click to choose the location of the denominator (green) in the unprojected TER3 CRISM image.  This may be done on *either the left panel (I/F image) or the right panel (summary parameter RGB). By default, the denominator ROI will conform to the same column as defined by the numerator ROI. This, and the ROI dimensions may be adjusted in the *ROI Settings* section. 
 
SUMMARY PARAMETER RGB: 
The right panel image may display statistically-stretchebrowse products (from the associated BR... files), or as the component summary parameters (from the associated SU...files), although these default to a 3-sigma linear stretch of all information in the image, on both negative and positive ends of the distribution.

SETUP PRIOR TO INFO EXTRACTION:  
Before extracting information from the ROIs you have set, checking the relevant MICA spectra and morphologic characteristics will allow these selections to be saved, with the extracted ROI information.  Further, if LCP or HCP is selected, the wavelength of the peak between BI and BII will be calculated, as well as the continuum-removed BII center and continuum-removed BI center. BI center and the peak between BI & BII will also be calculated when Mg/Fe- olivine is selected. Likewise, if any phyllosilicate or carboante is selected, the band center of the Fe/Mg/Al-OH band (2.1-2.4 microns) will be calculated. If any carbonate, Fe/Mg-phyllosilicate, or zeolite is selected, the 2.5 micron band center will be calculated. 
 
EXTRACTION: 
Once you have set the ROIs and selected the spectra, morphology, and added any comments, click the "Data Extraction" button and the table on "Interrogation Data Extraction" tab is populated with the relevant information.  Subsequent clicks of the extraction button will populate subsequent rows of the table. 
 
SAVING/RESTORING TABLE INFORMATION: 
Use "File">"Save table as..." to save the table of information as an .ascii that may then be imported in other programs, or restored using the "File">"Restore table..." option for adding more data to the same file.  Lastly, if a file name has already been defined, a quick "File">"Save" will update file contents.
